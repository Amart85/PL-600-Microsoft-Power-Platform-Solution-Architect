# Exercise Overview
-----------------

During this exercise, you will be reviewing project details for Contoso. This
includes a set of requirements gathered from customer workshop sessions. You
will use this information to design a high-level architecture and complete a fit
gap analysis.

#### Learning Objectives

After completing the exercise, you will be able to:

-   Perform evaluation of requirements to decide which approach to take

-   Develop a high-level architecture for a set of requirements

-   Perform a gap analysis from the Dynamics 365 apps used and the requirements

### Exercise 1: Evaluate Project Details
------------------------------------

Open and review the Project Details.docx file.

This contains the following information:

-   Project Scenario and Overview

-   Key Facts

-   Requirements

As you review the document your team should take notes as you go and start to
develop a proposed design to meet the requirements.

### Exercise 2: Complete the Project Workbook
-----------------------------------------

Open and complete the worksheets in the Project Workbook.xlsx file.

Complete each of the following tabs:

-   **High-level architecture diagram** – Create a simple high-level
    architecture diagram. This can be a picture of a whiteboard, a photo of a
    paper drawing. Simply paste it into the worksheet tab.

-   **Dynamics 365 apps used** – Document which apps you used and a brief
    description how it will be used.

-   **Fit Gap** – For each requirement complete the priority, level of effort,
    category and implementation details.

Your work will be reviewed by another team in a future exercise, so provide the
level of detail you would want from the team you review.
